''' <summary>
''' A multiple-producer, single-consumer lock-free queue.
''' Does NOT guarantee an item has been queued when BeginEnqueue finishes.
''' Does guarantee an item will eventually be queued after BeginEnqueue finishes.
''' Does guarantee that, for calls simultaneously in BeginEnqueue, at least one will finish with its item having been enqueued.
''' Does guarantee that, if BeginEnqueue(Y) is called after BeginEnqueue(X) finishes, Y will follow X in the queue.
''' </summary>
''' <remarks>
''' Performance characteristics:
''' - All operations are guaranteed constant time.
''' - Latency between BeginEnqueue finishing and the item being enqueued can be delayed arbitrarily by slowing down only one of the producers.
''' - (How does this compare to CAS-based implementations in terms of average throughput? It should be higher?)
